# Coding Standards
In general, make sure to follow these guidelines for any python code:
* Use Tabs for indentation
* 1 Tab == 8 spaces
* snake\_case for variable names

The lean code generated by the program uses 2 spaces for indentation, however this might change later on. For now, make sure any lean code generated by the program uses 2 spaces for indentation.
